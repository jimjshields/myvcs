# My Version Control System

### Part 1 - Basic backups

1. Single backup
  * Command line tool
  * Recursively copies everything in the current directory to a directory called `.myvcs`
  	* directory should be created if it doesn't exist
  	* can overwrite if it exists (for now)
2. Snapshots
  * put first backup into myvcs/1, second into myvcs/2, etc.
